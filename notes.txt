Large language models recieve prompts as an input 

Prompt Template 
- wrapper class around a prompt that allows the prompt to receive inputs 

Chat Models 
- wrapper class around LLMs that allows us to interact with them similar to a chat
- what the user sends has the role of human and what the llm sends has the role of AI
- responses are of type: AIMessageObject so they require additional filtering

Chain 
- allows us to combine multiple components together to create an application 

Output Parser
- parses the output of an LLM and serializes it
