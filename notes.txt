Large language models recieve prompts as an input 

Prompt Template 
- wrapper class around a prompt that allows the prompt to receive inputs 

Chat Models 
- wrapper class around LLMs that allows us to interact with them similar to a chat
- what the user sends has the role of human and what the llm sends has the role of AI
- responses are of type: AIMessageObject so they require additional filtering

Chain 
- allows us to combine multiple components together to create an application 

Output Parser
- parses the output of an LLM and serializes it

Agents
- performs actions on your behalf and can interact with llms (can access data llms do not have access too)
- agents use tools that are provided by the user and uses llm to determine what order to use them in 
- llm -> subtasks -> returns answer

Tools
- connects langchain with third-party sources
- contains description, function, and name
- Agent uses decription to determine which tools to use 

ReAct - reasoning and acting (prompt engineering technique how agents are built under the hood)
